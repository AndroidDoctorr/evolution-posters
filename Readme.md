# Evolution Posters

These posters are meant to visualize the ancestral paths that various plants and animals took to get where they are. The images are meant to represent major clades/species or groups of clades/species. The posters gloss over the full extent of even extant biodiversity, but depicting every clade, even just the ones that have been discovered by humans, would be nearly impossible, since this list is constantly growing, and the minutia of it are constantly being debated.
These are also intended to be clearer and simpler than similar posters - they include timelines, labels, and theoretical representatives of some extinct groups. Species are presented realistically and in chronological order as well as grouped by relationships.

## Animals and Plants

This maps the ancestry of common species and major archetypes in Kingdoms Plantae and Animalia from the Cambrian Explosion to the present.

## Primates

This shows the development and diversity of primates, from the most recent common ancestor of monkeys, apes, lemurs, and all other primates, about 75 million years ago, to the present.

## Hominids

This covers the known evolution and diversity of genus Homo, from Orrorin Tugenensis to Homo Spaiens Sapiens.

## Birds

This poster shows the evolution and diversity of the various known bird species, or groups of species, from their shared dinosaur ancestry, 95 million years ago, to present.

These projects include references where available. Some still need citation. I tried to find public domain or at least creative commons images, and I altered some of the images to look cleaner in isolation. This is intended to be used for educational purposes.
